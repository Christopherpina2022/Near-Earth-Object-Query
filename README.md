# Near-Earth-Object-Query
Uses the NeoWs API from NASA to show information about Near Earth Objects and other various information in a python GUI

There really isn't a purpose for this application, i'm just trying to learn APIs with the Nasa Near Earth Object Web Service since it was free to use.
I'm mainly just making an app with Tkinter's GUI to visualize data pulled straight out of the API and some other calculations that are dependent on the JSON file.
